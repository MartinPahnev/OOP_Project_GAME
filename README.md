# Fantasy Battle Simulator (C++)

This is a small C++ project I made. 
Itâ€™s a turn-based fantasy battle simulator with different unit types like Necromancers, Paladins, Wizards, and Undead creatures. 
The idea was to experiment with object-oriented programming (inheritance, polymorphism) and get some hands-on practice with game-like mechanics.  

## Features
- Different fantasy units with unique stats and abilities  
- Mana pool system to manage resources  
- Unit factory for creating characters  
- Simple cost and counter system to balance fights  

## How to Build/Run
1. Open the `.sln` file in **Visual Studio** (I used VS 2022 in order to preserve filters for the many classes).  
2. Build the solution (Debug or Release).  
3. Run the program from Visual Studio.
